The project was created by php Laravel framework and Mysql Data base and exist in the master branch 
The system parse an xml file and insert its content to the mysql Data Base.
I created a login page to let users upload any XML schema and add its origin the know the data source
The different data source could be putted in one exported xml or csv file or according to one origin to do not mix data
The xml file is parsed and inserted in a table with a field xml_data to form a row, this could be then traited by a json function that analyse the content with the key value stucture able to seperate the data fields.

As a summary I made a screenshots to see the execution and the process :  
1- Login page : please use login: chaari.adel@gmail.com  Password : 123456789
2- Use the menu in the left to add users or xml files as data source
3- Add xml to push its data to the database
4- Different sources could be used and pushed to the mysql Database  and displayed separately in a table in the program 
5- The data could be then exported from the app to an xml file separately or all together
